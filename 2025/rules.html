            We are sorry this is a lot to read, but it is necessary for everyone to
            understand the rules to avoid future conflicts.
            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Tagging Rules and Process:</strong>
            <br/><br/>

            Until toward the end of the game, you can be only be tagged outside of class time
            People doing classwork outside of class are safe e.g. Film Production, Video Production
            If you are outside of class and working you cannot tag others
            <br/><br/>
            Field trips are safe
            <br/><br/>
            Bathroom break is not safe
            <br/><br/>
            Spares/Flex blocks are not safe even if you are working
            <br/><br/>
            When a player successfully tags their target:
            <br/><br/>
            They acquire the target of the player they just tagged.
            The tagged player is eliminated from the game.
            This process continues until one player remains.
            Tie-Breakers (if more than one player survives):
            First tie-breaker: The player with the most successful tags wins.
            Second tie-breaker: If tags are equal, the player with the most recent successful tag wins.
