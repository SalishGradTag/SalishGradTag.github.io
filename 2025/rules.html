                    <u>DO NOT BREAK ANY LAWS</u>
                
                    <br><br>
                    You must be granted permission to enter ANY private property
                    <br><br><br>
                    
                </strong>
                
                <strong>Safe Locations, Times, and Situations where you CANNOT be tagged:</strong>
                <br/><br/>
            </center>
            
            

            <br><br>
            - After the final 20 players remain, classes will no longer be off limits with individual teacher permission.
            <br><br>

            - Inside classrooms <strong>during</strong> a scheduled class
            <br/><br/>
            - Doing classwork outside of class during class time e.g. Film Production, Video Production, or Photography
            <br>
            *If you are outside of class and working you cannot tag others
            <br/><br/>
            - School field trips
            <br/><br/>
            - During, 10 minutes before, and 10 minutes after athletic practices and games (these 10 minutes give coaches a chance to talk)
            <br/><br/>
            - During, 15 minutes before, and 15 minutes after work/a shift
            <br/><br/>
            - The bathroom, <strong>if</strong> target is there to use stalls or urinals (do not be creepy)
            <br><br><br><br>

            - The hallway to and from classes
            <br/><br/>
            - The bathroom if target is not using the facilities 
            (again, whether or not a target is legally allowed to be tagged should be clear, 
            especially if they have a pen in their hand)
            <br><br>
            - Spares/Flex blocks even if the target is working
            <br/><br/>

        Tagger will be sent the target of the target they just tagged.
        <br>
        The tagged player is eliminated from the game.
        <br>
        This process continues until one player remains.

        <strong>Game Rules:</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        
        <center>
            <strong>Tie-Breakers (if there is more than one player left at the end):</strong>
            <br><br>
            </center>
            
            <strong>- First tie-breaker:</strong> The player with the most successful tags wins.
            <br><br>
            <strong>- Second tie-breaker:</strong> If tags are equal, the player with the most recent successful tag wins.
            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Missing Class:</strong> 
            <br/><br>
            If a tagger reports that their target misses 5 consecutive days of school, 
            it will be verified using attendance, and they will subsequently be eliminated
            <br/><br/>
            
            Target
            Each player starts with one assigned target.
            Players are only allowed to tag their specific target at any given time.
            At one point
            <br/><br/>
            
            <strong>Tagging Rules:</strong>
            <br><br>
            
            A tag is only valid if the tagger physically taps their target with their open hand.
            No objects, tools, or projectiles can be used to tag.
            <br><br>
            
            
            <strong>Confirming tags:</strong>
            <br><br>
            All tags must be recorded on video to be considered valid.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The video must clearly show:</strong>
            <br><br>
            - The tag occurring.
            <br><br>
            - The tagged player's face.
            <br><br>
            <!-- "Proof that the tagged person" what does this mean Yash-->
            The video must be sent to the official grad tag instagram account within <strong>5 hours </strong>of the tag.
            <br/><br/>
            Tagged Players:
            <br><br>
            Once tagged, players are eliminated and can no longer tag others.
            Their target is passed on to their tagger.
            <br/><br/>
