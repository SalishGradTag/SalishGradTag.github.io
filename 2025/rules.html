                All decisions will be made according to these rules. Make sure to read them so that you know what to expect.
            <br><br><br>

            <strong> Tagging Rules:</strong>
            <br><br>
            A tag is only valid if the tagger physically taps their target with their open hand.
            No objects, tools, or projectiles can be used to tag unless the immunity item rules at the time create an exception.
            <br><br>
            All tags must be recorded on video to be considered valid.
            <br><br>
            The video must show:
            <br><br>
            - The tag occurring.
            <br><br>
            - The tagged player's face.
            <br><br>
            - Proof for any rules that might apply (immunity items, cars not moving, the time)
            <br><br>
            The video must be sent to the official grad tag instagram account within <strong>6 hours</strong> of the tag.
            <br><br>
            - Each week either have assigned target(s) or will not.
            <br/><br/>
            - Your target(s) will be sent to you through teams.
            <br><br>
            - When targets are assigned you may only tag people who are your target.
            <br><br>
            - When targets are not assigned you may tag anyone.
            <br><br>
            - The tagged player is <strong>eliminated</strong> from the game.
            <br><br><br>

            <strong>Leaderboard:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The leaderboard is ranked in the following order:
            <br><br>
            - Being alive
            <br><br>
            - Number of tags
            <br><br>
            - Recency of their last tag or the time survived
            <br><br>
            Prizes will be announced soon.
            <br><br><br>
            <strong>Safe situations where you CANNOT be tagged:</strong>
            <br><br>
            - Until only 20 players remain or May 12, whichever comes first, you will be safe when <strong>in class</strong>.
            <br><br>
            - You are <strong>in class</strong> if:
            <br><br>
            > Inside classrooms <strong>during</strong> a scheduled class
            <br/><br/>
            > Doing classwork outside of class (e.g. Film Production, Video Production, Photography, or Band). You may not tag people while doing class work outside of classrorom. This is to prevent people from tagging others while not taking any risk themselves.
            <br/><br/>
            > School field trips
            <br/><br/>
            > During, 10 minutes before, and 10 minutes after, band practices & concerts, and athletic practices & games (these 10 minutes give coaches and such a chance to talk)
            <br/><br/>
            > During, 10 minutes before, and 10 minutes after work/a shift
            <br/><br/>
            > Cars that are either moving or on the road.
            <br><br><br>

            <br/><br>
            If you report that your target that has been missing for 5 consecutive days of school they will be eliminated after their attendance is verified. You will not gain a tag from this but will get a new target.
            <br/><br/>
            Other exceptional circumstances will be decided on by the grad tag team.
            <br/><br/>
