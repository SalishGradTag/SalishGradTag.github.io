            <strong> Tagging Rules:</strong>
            <br><br>
            A tag is only valid if the tagger physically taps their target with their hand.
            No objects, tools, or projectiles can be used to tag unless the immunity item rules at the time create an exception.
            <br><br>
            When you tag your target you will obtain their target.
            <br><br>
            All tags must be recorded on video to be considered valid.
            <br><br>
            The video must show:
            <br><br>
            - The tag occurring.
            <br><br>
            - The tagged player's face.
            <br><br>
            - Proof of any rules that might apply (immunity items, cars parked, etc.)
            <br><br>
            - The video must be sent to the official grad tag instagram account within <strong>6 hours</strong> of the tag.
            <br><br>
            - Certain weeks may be free-for-alls without targets
            <br/><br/>
            - Your targets will be sent to you through teams.
            <br><br>
            - You may only tag people who are your target, unless otherwise specified.
            <br><br>
            - Targets can't be switched and can't make tags for other people.
            <br><br>
            - Tagged players will be <strong>eliminated</strong> from the game.
            <br><br>
            - You not may break any laws against your target in order to tag them.
            <br><br><br>

            Until only 20 players remain or May 12, whichever comes first, you will be safe when in class.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Special Circumstances</strong></center>
            <br/><br>
            If you report to the salishgradtag Instagram account that your target that has been missing for 5 consecutive days 
            of school they will be eliminated after their attendance is verified. 
            You will not gain a tag from this but will get a new target, so it may be in your 
            interest to wait for them to return instead of ratting them out.
            <br/><br/>
            Other special circumstances will be decided by the Grad Tag team.
            <br/><br/>
