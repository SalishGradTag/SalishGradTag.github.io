            All decisions will be made according to these rules. Make sure to read them so that you know what to expect.
            Hard evidence such as a video will be prioritized over word of mouth when making decisions.
            <br><br><br>

            <strong> Tagging Rules:</strong>
            <br><br>
            A tag is only valid if the tagger physically taps their target with their hand.
            No objects, tools, or projectiles can be used to tag unless the immunity item rules at the time create an exception.
            <br><br>
            When you tag your target you will obtain their target.
            <br><br>
            All tags must be recorded on video to be considered valid.
            <br><br>
            The video must show:
            <br><br>
            - The tag occurring.
            <br><br>
            - The tagged player's face.
            <br><br>
            - Proof of any rules that might apply (immunity items, cars parked, etc.)
            <br><br>
            - The video must be sent to the official grad tag instagram account within <strong>6 hours</strong> of the tag.
            <br><br>
            - Certain weeks may be free-for-alls without targets
            <br/><br/>
            - Your targets will be sent to you through teams.
            <br><br>
            - You may only tag people who are your target, unless otherwise specified.
            <br><br>
            - People should not cover there face in order to hide from getting recorded in a tag.
            <br><br>
            - Targets can't be switched and can't make tags for other people.
            <br><br>
            - Tagged players will be <strong>eliminated</strong> from the game.
            <br><br>
            - You not may break any laws against your target in order to tag them.

            <strong>
            Safe situations where you CANNOT be tagged:
            <br><br>
            Until only 20 players remain, or May 12, whichever comes first, you will be safe in class from the minute class begins (inclusive) until the minute class ends (exclusive) on the classroom clock.
            <br><br>
            (for example, in class b block, on non-flex days, targets are safe from 9:22 (inclusive) to 10:45 (exclusive). this means once the clock hits 10:45, targets are no longer safe in their b block classes)
            <br><br>
            E-block is safe until the teacher dismisses you.
            <br><br>
            You are in class if:
            </strong>
            <br><br>
            - Talking to staff or a teacher after class

            <br/><br/>
            - You are doing classwork outside of class during that class' block (e.g. Film Production, Video Production, Photography, or Band). You may not tag people while doing class work outside of the classroom. 
            This is to prevent people from tagging others while not taking any risk themselves.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>These situations are always safe:</strong>
            <br/><br/>

            <br/><br/>
            - Unscheduled shifts are only safe during the duration of the shift.
            <br/><br/>

            <br/><br/>
            - While switching classes
            <br/><br/>

            <br><br>
            - Spares/Flex blocks even if the target is doing work
            <br><br><br>
            
            <Strong>Immunity</Strong>
            <br><br>
            - Every day will have an <strong>immunity item</strong>
            <br><br>
            - The immunity item will be announced for a range of days (a week, a weekend, etc.).
            <br><br>
            - The rules for each <strong>immunity item</strong> will be defined once it is announced. Be sure to check the rules to make sure you are fitting the criteria for each week.
            <br><br>
            - Any person following the immunity item criteria will be immune from getting tagged
            <br><br>
            - <strong>Purges</strong> may have exceptionally difficult items to obtain
            <br><br>
            - You may not steal anyone's immunity item, or have someone else steal anyone's immunity item.
            <br><br>
            - Two people may not share immunity items, the owner of the item gets priority on the target. If neither own the item the person who was touching it first will get the item.
            <br><br>
            - You may not attack people in order to prevent a target from reaching their immunity item or knock an immunity item out of someone's hand.
            <br><br><br>

            <center><strong>Special Circumstances</strong></center>
            <br/><br>
            If you report to the salishgradtag Instagram account that your target that has been missing A-D blocks for 5 consecutive days they will be eliminated after their attendance is verified. 
            You will not gain a tag from this but will get a new target, so it may be in your 
            interest to wait for them to return instead of ratting them out.
            <br/><br/>
            If you are only attending careers/disctrict program please message us as we are trying to fix this.
            <br/><br/>
            All decisions will be decided by the Grad Tag team.

            Pillows
            <br><br>
            From March 10 to March 16.
            <br><br>
            Pillows must be a minimum of 30cm X 10cm X 3cm in volume.
            <br><br>
            Pillows must be soft and something that is plausible to be slept on.
            <br><br>
            Pillows must be one "shape", meaning they cannot have any extruding objects. For example a stuffed bear is not considered a pillow because it has arms and a tail however a pillow that depicts a bear is fine if it is one shape.
            <br><br>
            They must be held up by your body. This means you can't hold them with string/tape, you can't tie the pillow to your body, or any other way that would mean you are not holding it up.
            <br><br>
            The pillow must be visible to keep you safe. The tagger must make an effort to check if the pillow is visible or not and show it in the video.
